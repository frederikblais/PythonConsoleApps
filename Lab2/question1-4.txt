Question 1:
    a. What command line displays the content
    of a file?
    >>> nano [filename]

    b. What command allows you to run a
    program with the root user account’s
    privilege?
    >>> sudo -> for one time execution ex: sudo apt-get intall vim
    >>> su - -> to sign in as root to execute multiple commands as a super user
        ex:
        $ su -
        $ password:
        # apt-get install vim
        # apt-get install vnc
        # shutdown

Question 2:
    Find at least 3 differences between
    Python v2 and Python v3.
    >>> 1. In Python 2, it is not compulsory to use parenthesis. e.g. print “Hello World” vs In Python 3, it is compulsory to use parenthesis. e.g. print (“Hello World”)
    >>> 2. To make a string Unicode in Python 2, should use a character ‘u’. e.g. u “Hello” vs In Python 3, string is Unicode by default.
    >>> 3. In Python 2, integer division returns an integer.  7/ 2 gives 3. To get the exact answer, the programmer should use 7.0 / 2. 0 vs In Python 3, integer division can give a float answer. 7 / 2 will give 3.5.

Question 3:
    When a variable is created, what is his data type?
    >>> Python will assign the variable's datatype based on its value
        ex: var = 1 -> datatype = int
            var2 = 'HelloWorld' -> datatype = str
            var3 = 0.6 -> datatype = float

Question 4:
    4. Explain the use of the escape sequences
    >>> An escape sequence is a character or series or characters that allow a Python statement to escape from normal behavior.
        You can use the escape sequence by using the character \ in a string or in an output.
        ex: \" , \' , \n, \t, \r, \$, \\
